5. Payment Terms
5.1 Fee Structure
Fees for each project will be agreed upon in writing prior to commencement. Projects may be structured as a fixed-price engagement, milestone-based payments, or an hourly rate, as specified in the project proposal or invoice.
5.2 Deposit
A deposit of between 30% and 50% of the total project fee is required before work commences, unless otherwise agreed in writing. The deposit is non-refundable and confirms the Client's commitment to the project.
5.3 Payment Methods
We accept payment via bank transfer (EFT), and where available, via payment gateway (e.g. Stripe). All amounts are in Australian Dollars (AUD) and are exclusive of GST unless otherwise stated.
5.4 Non-Refundable Payments
All payments made are non-refundable once the corresponding work or milestone has been delivered or commenced, as applicable. This includes the initial deposit and all subsequent milestone payments.

Additional revisions or changes that fall outside the agreed project scope will be billed at our standard hourly rate, which will be communicated to the Client before additional work commences.

Significant scope changes requested by the Client may require a revised project timeline and updated pricing. We will confirm any such adjustments in writing before proceeding.
