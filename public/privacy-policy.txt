This Privacy Policy describes how Ananta Systems (we, us, or our) collects, uses, stores, and protects personal information in connection with the web development, design, and technology services we provide to our clients (Client) and, where applicable, the end-users of websites and applications we build on their behalf (End-User).

Ananta Systems is a sole trader business operating in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. We are committed to handling all personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).

By engaging our services or using any website or application we develop, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
2. Scope of This Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to:
•	Personal information provided directly to us by Clients engaging our web development, design, or maintenance services.
•	Information processed through websites, web applications, and digital systems we build or maintain on behalf of Clients.
•	Any interactions with our own business website or communication channels.

This policy does not apply to third-party websites, services, or platforms that we may link to or integrate with. Those services are governed by their own privacy policies.
3. Information We Collect
3.1 Client Information
When a Client engages our services, we may collect the following personal information:
•	Full name and business name
•	Email address and phone number
•	Business address and billing information
•	ABN or other business identifiers
•	Project requirements, briefs, and any content or materials provided to us
•	Login credentials or access details shared for the purpose of completing work (e.g. hosting accounts, CMS access)
3.2 End-User Information (via Client Websites)
Where we build or maintain websites that collect data from End-Users on behalf of Clients, such data may include:
•	Names and contact details submitted via contact or enquiry forms
•	Email addresses submitted via newsletter subscription forms
•	Account registration details (if applicable)
•	Booking or appointment information (where booking systems are integrated)
•	Payment information processed through third-party gateways such as Stripe or PayPal
•	Usage data collected via analytics tools such as Google Analytics
•	Data submitted through any other forms or interactive elements on the website

We act as a Data Processor in relation to End-User data. The Client remains the Data Controller and is responsible for ensuring their own compliance with applicable privacy laws in relation to their End-Users.
3.3 Automatically Collected Information
When you interact with websites or applications we operate or maintain, we or our third-party tools may automatically collect:
•	IP addresses and browser/device information
•	Pages visited, time spent on pages, and referral sources
•	Cookies and similar tracking technologies (see Section 9)
4. How We Use Information
We use the personal information we collect for the following purposes:
•	To provide, manage, and deliver our web development and design services to Clients
•	To communicate with Clients regarding project progress, invoicing, and support
•	To enable the functionality of websites and applications we build (e.g. processing form submissions, sending notification emails via Resend, managing database records via Supabase)
•	To process or facilitate payments through third-party payment gateways
•	To monitor website performance and improve user experience via analytics tools
•	To maintain the security and integrity of the systems we build and manage
•	To comply with our legal obligations and enforce our agreements
•	To provide AI-powered features where integrated (e.g. chatbots or automated responses), using third-party AI service providers
5. How We Store and Protect Information
We take the security of personal information seriously and implement a range of technical and organisational measures to protect it, including:
•	Use of HTTPS encryption across all websites and applications we develop
•	Secure cloud database storage via Supabase, with access controls and encrypted connections
•	Cloudflare protection for DDoS mitigation, web application firewall, and traffic security
•	Password protection and access control practices for all systems
•	Regular backups with restricted access

Despite these measures, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security and are not liable for unauthorised access resulting from circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including third-party breaches, Client-side security failures, or unforeseen vulnerabilities.
6. Third-Party Services
In the course of building and operating websites and applications, we may engage the following categories of third-party service providers:
•	Cloud Hosting & Infrastructure: Cloudflare (CDN, security, DNS)
•	Database & Backend Services: Supabase (cloud database hosting and authentication)
•	Payment Gateways: Stripe and/or PayPal (for processing transactions on Client websites)
•	Email Delivery: Resend (for transactional email delivery such as form notifications and booking confirmations)
•	Analytics: Google Analytics (for website traffic and usage analysis)
•	Artificial Intelligence: Third-party AI platforms (for AI-powered features such as chatbots or automated messaging)

These third parties may collect, process, or store personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage Clients and End-Users to review those policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, data breaches, service outages, or security incidents of any third-party provider.

We do not authorise any third-party provider to use personal information for any purpose other than providing the specific service they are engaged to perform.
7. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We may share personal information only in the following circumstances:
•	With third-party service providers as described in Section 6, solely to the extent necessary to operate and deliver our services
•	Where required by law, a court order, or a lawful request from a government authority or regulatory body
•	In connection with a business transfer, merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, where personal information may be transferred as part of that transaction
8. Artificial Intelligence Features
Where AI-powered features are integrated into websites or applications we build (such as chatbots, automated response systems, or content generation tools), the following applies:
•	Data including user messages and business information may be transmitted to third-party AI service providers (such as OpenAI) to generate responses
•	We configure such integrations to prevent End-User data from being used to train third-party public AI models, where such configuration is available
•	AI-generated outputs may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete, or unexpected. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from reliance on AI-generated content
•	Clients are responsible for clearly disclosing to their End-Users when AI tools are in use on their platforms
9. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
Websites and applications we develop may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to:
•	Enable core website functionality and user sessions
•	Collect analytics data via Google Analytics to understand how visitors interact with the site
•	Remember user preferences and settings

Users can control or disable cookies through their browser settings. Disabling certain cookies may affect the functionality of the website. Where required by law, cookie consent notices will be implemented on Client websites.
10. Data Retention
We retain personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this policy:
•	Client information is retained for the duration of the engagement and for a reasonable period thereafter (generally up to 7 years) for accounting, legal, and tax compliance purposes
•	Project files, backups, and associated data may be retained for up to 12 months following project completion, after which they will be securely deleted unless otherwise agreed
•	End-User data collected through Client websites is retained in accordance with the Client's own data retention practices, as we act only as a Data Processor in that context

When personal information is no longer required, we will take reasonable steps to securely delete or de-identify it.
11. Client Responsibilities
Clients who engage our services acknowledge and agree to the following:
•	All personal information and content provided to us must be accurate, lawful, and provided with any necessary consents
•	Clients are responsible for ensuring their own websites and digital platforms comply with applicable privacy laws, including the Australian Privacy Principles, and any other relevant legislation applicable to their End-Users

•	Clients must ensure their End-Users are appropriately informed about how their data is collected and used, including through the publication of their own privacy policy
•	Clients are responsible for all content (including images, text, and third-party materials) provided to us for use in their website, and must hold all necessary rights or licences for such content
12. Security Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
We implement industry-standard security practices; however, we expressly disclaim liability for the following:
•	Hacking, unauthorised access, or data breaches affecting Client or End-User data, particularly where resulting from third-party vulnerabilities or Client-side security failures

Our liability in connection with any privacy or data-related matter is limited to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Australian law.
13. Data Breach Response

•	Assess the breach and contain it as quickly as reasonably practicable
•	Notify affected Clients promptly where required
•	Where required by the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme under the Privacy Act 1988, notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and affected individuals

Clients are responsible for managing their own breach notification obligations in relation to their End-Users.

Under the Australian Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles, you have the right to:
•	Request access to the personal information we hold about you
•	Request correction of any inaccurate, incomplete, or out-of-date information

•	Withdraw consent to our processing of your personal information (where processing is based on consent)
•	Lodge a complaint with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) at www.oaic.gov.au if you believe we have breached the APPs

15. Children's Privacy
Our services are directed at businesses and adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected information from a minor, we will take prompt steps to delete that information. If you believe we may hold information about a child, please contact us immediately.
16. International Data Transfers
Some of the third-party services we use (including Supabase, Cloudflare, Stripe, Resend, Google Analytics, and AI platforms) may store or process data in countries outside of Australia, including the United States. We take reasonable steps to ensure that such transfers occur in compliance with the Australian Privacy Act and that appropriate data protection safeguards are in place.

By engaging our services, Clients acknowledge that their information and the information of their End-Users may be transferred to and processed in countries outside Australia.
